# Sensei Bob Noel

![Sensei Bob Noel]({{ site.url }}/assets/sensei-bob-noel.jpg){: .img-responsive }

I first became involved in Uechi-ryu Karate in 1979 and have been a student for over 35 years.  I have been teaching Uechiryu for the past 15-20 years, first in Massachusetts and now here in Knoxville.  I am ranked a Yondan (4th Degree Black Belt), and I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to study under some of the very best American Uechiryu Masters.

Uechiryu Karate, the art that Kanbun Uechi brought back to his island home of Okinawa, is essentially the same martial system taught in most Uechiryu schools today. The style has not been simplified or watered-down. Uechiryu is still the vigorous system of self-defense that it has always been. Uechiryu is not about: flash, flying through the air, katas performed to music, tie-dye uniforms, or a fast-track to a black belt. Indeed, Uechi is as far removed from the Hollywood version of martial arts as you can get.  Uechiâ€™s rigorous training and the philosophy encouraged in the dojo help to build self-confidence, relieve stress, and foster emotional well being.  I have enjoyed training and teaching Uechiryu Karate for many years, and I hope you will give Uechiryu a try and join me for my classes.
