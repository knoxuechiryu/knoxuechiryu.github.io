When I was in my teens, I had to participate in a cultural fair as part of some class in high school.  One of my classmates was studying karate.  Somehow or another, we hit on the idea of doing a karate demonstration even though I didn't know any karate.  So my classmate took two of us over to the dojo and taught us kyukumite #1.  The classmate who knew karate talked through the demo while the other classmate and me did kyukumite #1.  I liked the teacher of the dojo (T. Rose) and asked my parents if I could start studying there.

I had multiple reasons for wanting to study.  I was bullied a lot as a teenager.  I was a large, tall young man.  I didn't like to fight.  I wasn't quick with the retort.  I was the perfect target for hormone-fueled teenagers to show how they could put someone down to their friends.  Learning karate gave me hope that if I ever did decide to fight back (spoiler alert: I didn't), maybe I would win.  Also, I really liked T. Rose.  

I studied karate through high school and achieved green belt if I remember correctly.  I went to college and promptly forgot all about it.  After college, I returned to Massachusetts to work.  I had gained a lot of weight in college.  A friend of mine encouraged me to rejoin karate and use it to lose weight.  I lost about 40 lbs by just eating reasonably and going to karate 2.5 times per week.

Karate has given me many things.  Sanchin kata is a form of meditation for me. Visualizing it can help me weather emotionally intense situations. It helps me stay active. I feel great when I can pass on some of what Bob & T. Rose have taught me to others. So I got into it to learn how to defeat bullies and instead learned to calm my mind and spirit.
